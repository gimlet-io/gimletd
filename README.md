# gimletd - the GitOps release manager

GimletD acts as a release manager and detaches the release workflow from CI. By doing so, it unlocks the possibility of advanced release logics and flexibility to refactor workflows.

By assuming all release related work, it adds central control to the release workflow by introducing policy based deploys and advanced authorization and security standards, while it also optimizes the GitOps repository write performance.

See the [documentation](https://gimlet.io/gimletd/getting-started/).
